# This is sorting algorithm (merge sort) #
In computer science, merge sort is an efficient, 
general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that 
the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. 
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented 
by John von Neumann in 1945.
